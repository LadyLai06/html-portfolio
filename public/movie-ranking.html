<h1>The Best Movies According to Laila</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>
   Harry Potter is probably the best and most favorite movie for me. It has a wonderful story about how your life can change and all the adventures within.
   I love the references to pshycology throughout the movies as well.

<h3>Inside Out</h3>
<p>
   Both Inside Out and Inside Out 2 are such great movie that represent a very valid picture of our emotions. Although it is a kids movie, I very much enjoy this as an adult!
</p>
<h3>The Notebook</h3>
<p>
   Such a beautiful movie. Filled with lots of romance but what I enjoy as well is the background hints about how someone can love you, like a parent, but the things they do out of love can actually be holding you back from finding your true happiness.
